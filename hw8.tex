\item Show that the set of semi-incompressible strings is not computable. \\\\
Assume that the set of semi-incompressible strings is computable to reach a contradiction. \\
Therefore $\exists$ TM $M$ the computes the set of semi-incompressible strings. \\
Consider the TM $N$ that for each string $x$ of size $n$: \\
\tab Run $M$. If $x$ is generated by $M$ print $x$ and halt. \\
$N$ has $n$ hard-coded into it using $log_{2} (n)$ bits and the rest of $N$'s encoding is represented using some constant amount of bits $k$. Therefore $|N| = O(log_{2} n)$, which is $< \sqrt{n}$ for a sufficiently large $n$, i.e. $\exists$ a TM $N$ that can represent $x$ where $|N| < \sqrt{|x|}$, contradicting the semi-incompressibility of $x$.\\

\item Show that there are finitely many incompressible strings with an equal number of 1's and 0's. \\\\
Every string $s$ where $s$ has the same number of $0$s and $1$s and $|s| \geq 4$ is compressible to size $|s - 1|$.\\
For every string $s$ of length $n$, where $n \geq 4$, there are enough strings of length $n - 1$ to hold all strings in $s$.\\
The number of strings with the same number of $0$s and $1$s make up $frac{1}{\sqrt(n)}$ of all strings of length $n$.
Consider flipping a coin $n$ times and recording a $0$ if it lands on heads, $1$ if it lands on tails. This has a probability of happening $frac{1}{\sqrt(n)}$ times.
So there are $\frac{2^n}{\sqrt{n}}$ strings of length $n$ that have the same number of $0$s and $1$s.\\

So if $\frac{2^n}{\sqrt{n}} \leq 2^{n - 1}$, then there are enough strings of length $n - 1$ to hold each string of length $n$ which have the same number of $0$s and $1$s.\\

$\begin{aligned}
\frac{2^n}{\sqrt{n}} \leq 2^{n - |M|} &\iff n \geq 2^{2|M|} \\
\frac{2^n}{2^{n - |M|}} \leq \sqrt{n} &\iff n \geq 2^{2|M|} \\
2^{|M|} \leq \sqrt{n} &\iff n \geq 2^{2|M|} \\
2^{2|M|} \leq n &\iff n \geq 2^{2|M|} \\
\end{aligned}$

\item Show that the set of incompressible strings contains no infinite subset that is recursively enumerable.\\\\
Let $I$ be the set of incompressible strings and let $S \subset I$ be an infinite subset of $I$. Assume that there is an infinite subset of incompressible strings $S$ that is recursively enumerable. Then there must be a TM $M$ which can enumerate $S$. There are two cases:
\begin{enumerate}
\item If $\exists x \in S$ where $|x| > |M|$, then $x$ is compressible, which is a contradiction
\item If $!\exists x \in S$ where $|x| > |M|$, then $S$ is finite, which is also a contradiction
\end{enumerate}
In any case, the existence of both $M$ and $S$ creates a contradiction so our assumption is false and there is no infinite subset of incompressible strings that is recursively enumerable.

\item Show that the set of compressible strings is recursively enumerable.\\\\
A string is compressible if it is not incompressible.\\
The set of all strings is enumerable. Consider each string to be an integer of base $|\Gamma|$ where $|\Gamma|$ is the size of the alphabet. \\
For an alphabet $\Gamma = \{0, 1\}$, then $ALL\_STRINGS = \{\epsilon, 0, 1, 00, 01, 10, 11, 000, 001,...\}$
Consider the TM $M$ which: \\
For each string $s$ in $ALL\_STRINGS$: \\
	\tab for each string $t$ in $ALL\_STRINGS$ where $|t| < |s|$ \\
		\tab\tab if $t$ describes $s$, output $s$ and break to outer for loop \\		
Since $|t|$ is less than $|s|$, and $t$ perfectly describes $s$, then $t$ is a compressed version of $s$. Therefore, $s$ is compressible. Since $M$ checks all strings which are less than the given string $s$, then $M$ will eventually find a compressed version of $s$ if it exists. Therefore $L(M)$, the set of compressible strings, is recursively enumerable.
