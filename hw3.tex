\subsection*{a}
Claim:\\
There is no Turing Machine that takes input TM $M$ and determines whether the language $L(M)$ accepted by $M$ is the empty language.\\\\
Proof by reduction:\\

\subsection*{b}
Claim:\\
There is no Turing Machine that takes input TM $M$ and determines whether the language $L(M)$ accepted by $M$ is the language of every string over the input alphabet.\\\\
Proof by reduction:\\

\subsection*{c}
Claim:\\
There is no Turing Machine that takes input TM $M$ and determines whether the language $L(M)$ accepted by $M$ includes the string 11110.\\\\
Proof by reduction:\\

\subsection*{d}
Claim:\\
Given some property $P$ of languages, there is no Turing Machine that takes input TM $M$ and determines whether the language $L(M)$ accepted by $M$ satisfies $P$.\\\\
Proof by reduction:\\

\subsection*{e}
To show that 4.a, 4.b, 4.c are consequences of 4.d:
\begin{enumerate}
\item For problem 4.a, let $P_a$ be the property that the language is empty
\item For problem 4.b, let $P_b$ be the property that the language is every string over the input alphabet
\item For problem 4.c, let $P_c$ be the property that the string 11110 is in the language
\end{enumerate}
Each bullet's $P$ is a valid property for a language, thus we can apply the result of 4.d to show 4.a,4.b,4.c are consequences of 4.d.
