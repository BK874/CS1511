\subsection*{a}
Claim:\\
There is no Turing Machine that takes input TM $M$ and determines whether the language $L(M)$ accepted by $M$ is the empty language.\\\\
Proof by reduction:\\
We will reduce the Halting Problem $HP$ to the stated Empty Language Problem $ELP$. Let $\left<X, w\right>$ be the input to $HP$, where $X$ is a TM and $w$ is the input to the TM. Then create a new TM $N$ from $\left<X, w\right>$ where $N$ rejects in all cases where input to $N$ is not $w$, and when the input is $w$, $N$ runs $X$ on $w$. Finally, pass $N$ as input to the $ELP$ and return the opposite of $ELP$'s output.\\
If $X$ halts on  $w$, then:
\begin{itemize}
\item $N$ will accept on $w$
\item $ELP$ will return 0 since $N$ accepts a non-empty input
\item $HP$ returns the opposite, which is 1
\end{itemize}
so $HP$ returns 1 if $ELP$ returns 0.
Next, if $X$ loops forever on $w$, then:
\begin{itemize}
\item $N$ will not accept on $w$
\item $N$ rejects any other input
\item $N$ always rejects
\item $ELP$ returns 1 since $N$ has no strings in $L(N)$ that accept
\item $HP$ returns the opposite, which is 0
\end{itemize}
so $HP$ returns 0 if $ELP$ returns 1.\\
Finally, $HP$ $\leftrightarrow$ $!ELP$, so $HP \le ELP$, and thus $ELP$ is undecidable.

\subsection*{b}
Claim:\\
There is no Turing Machine that takes input TM $M$ and determines whether the language $L(M)$ accepted by $M$ is the language of every string over the input alphabet.\\\\
Proof by reduction:\\
We will reduce the Halting Problem $HP$ to the stated Complete Language Problem $CLP$. Let $\langle X, w \rangle$ be the input to $HP$, where $X$ is a TM and $w$ is the input to the TM.  Then create a new TM $N$ from $\langle X, w \rangle$ where $N$ accepts in all cases where the input to $N$ is not $w$, and when the input is $w$, $N$ runs $X$ on $w$. Finally, pass $N$ as input to the $CLP$ and return the same as $CLP$'s output.\\
If $X$ halts on $w$, then:
\begin{itemize}
\item $N$ will accept on $w$
\item $N$ accepts all other inputs
\item $N$ always accepts
\item $CLP$ will return 1 since $N$ accepts all strings
\item $HP$ returns the same output, 1
\end{itemize}
so $HP$ returns 1 if $CLP$ returns 1.
Next, if $X$ loops forever on $w$, then:
\begin{itemize}
\item $N$ will not accept on $w$
\item $N$ did not accept all inputs
\item $CLP$ returns 0 since there are strings in $L(N)$ that $N$ does not accept
\item $HP$ returns then same, 0
\end{itemize}
so $HP$ returns 0 if $CLP$ returns 0.\\
Finally, $HP$ $\leftrightarrow$ $CLP$, so $HP \le CLP$, and thus $CLP$ is undecidable.

\subsection*{c}
Claim:\\
There is no Turing Machine that takes input TM $M$ and determines whether the language $L(M)$ accepted by $M$ includes the string 11110.\\\\
Proof by reduction:\\

\subsection*{d}
Claim:\\
Given some property $P$ of languages, there is no Turing Machine that takes input TM $M$ and determines whether the language $L(M)$ accepted by $M$ satisfies $P$.\\\\
Proof by reduction:\\

\subsection*{e}
To show that 4.a, 4.b, 4.c are consequences of 4.d:
\begin{enumerate}
\item For problem 4.a, let $P_a$ be the property that the language is empty
\item For problem 4.b, let $P_b$ be the property that the language is every string over the input alphabet
\item For problem 4.c, let $P_c$ be the property that the string 11110 is in the language
\end{enumerate}
Each bullet's $P$ is a valid property for a language, thus we can apply the result of 4.d to show 4.a,4.b,4.c are consequences of 4.d.
