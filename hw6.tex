\subsection*{a}
Since $L(N) = \overline  {L(M)}$, then $N$ can be constructed as a modified $M$ where $M$'s non accepting states are accepting and vice versa.
\subsection*{b}
$P = N \cap M$ where the ''$\cap$'' symbol represents the closure under the DFAs so that $L(P) = \{x | x \in L(N) \land x \in L(M)\}$.
\subsection*{c}
Every accepting state of $P$ has a transition on the final character of the encoding of $w$. Since $Q$ does not have an input for $w$, consider $Q$ as a modification of $P$ which contains no states involved with the transitions for $w$. The accepting states of $Q$ are all states with any transition over a character in $w$ from the equivalent state in $P$ which leads to an accepting state.

\subsection*{d}
Every accepting state of $Q$ has a transition on the final character of the encoding of $z$. Since $R$ does not have an input for $z$, consider $R$ as a modification of $Q$ which contains no states involved with the transitions for $z$. The accepting states of $R$ are all states with transitions over a character in $z$ from the equivalent state in $Q$ that lead to an accepting state.

\subsection*{e}
Every accepting state of $S$ has a transition on the final character of the encoding of $y$. Since $R$ does not have an input for $y$, consider $S$ as a modification of $R$ which contains no states involved with the transitions for $y$. The accepting states of $S$ are all states with transitions over a character in $y$ from the equivalent state in $R$ that lead to an accepting state.

\subsection*{f}
Treat the DFA $S$ as a directed graph such that each vertex is a state and each directed edge between some vertices $q_a$ and $q_b$ represents the transition $\delta(q_a, c) \rightarrow q_b$ for some character $c$. Compute a breadth-first search on $S$ starting from the start state $q_0$ and accept if an accepting state is ever encountered. If the breadth-first search finishes without finding any accept states, then reject. \\

This algorithm works because if there exists an accepting state in the search's resultant tree, then there exists a path on $S$ from the start state $q_0$ to an accepting state. Each edge in the path represents a character $c$, and the path taken to the accepting state is a string $c_1c_2c_3...c_n$. But if there is no path to an accepting state in $S$, then there is no string of this form, and so $L(S) = \emptyset$
