Initial Approach:
Construct a TM $U$ which takes an input $x$, runs $T(x)$, and then $S(T(x))$ and returns the result. $U$ correctly accepts $x$ if and only if $x \in A$, however the space needed to store the temporary result $T(x)$ as input to $S$ could be more than $log(|x|)$ in space.\\\\
New Approach:
Instead modify $T$ to produce output for $S$ on-demand. That is, have $U$ use a modified $T'$ which takes a string $x$ and int $i$ and only writes the $i^{th}$ symbol of $x$ to the output tape. Adding a counter to $T$ to track this space only requires an additional $log(|x|)$ space. Next, have $U$ use a modified $S'$ which runs $T'(x,i)$ when it needs the $i^{th}$ symbol.\\
The new approach will have a TM $U$ which runs $T'$ and $S'$ which are both $log(|x|)$ in space, so $U$ is $log(|x|)$ in space while also accepting $A$.

\subsection*{a}
Let $C = \left\{ \left( M, I, 2^{|I|^k} \right) \mid \text{ TM } M \text{ accepts } I \text{ in at most } 2^{|I|^k} \text{ space } \right\}$.\\
First we will show that $C \in EXPSPACE$:\\ 
Construct a TM $T$ that takes in the tuple $(M, I, 2^{I^{k}})$, reads $I$, and runs $M$ on $I$ with a tape of size $2^{|I|^{k}}$. \\ 
$T$ accepts if $M$ accepts and used less than $2^{|I|^{k}}$ space and rejects otherwise. \\
Because the TM $M$ uses exponential space, $T$ must also have exponential space available and therefore $C \in EXPSPACE$. \\ \\ 
Next, we will show that $\forall C' \in EXPSPACE$, $C' \leq_{poly} C$. \\
Let $C' \in EXPSPACE$. \\
Since $C' \in EXPSPACE$, $\exists$ TM $M$ and $k \in \Z$ such that $M(x)$ accepts in $2^{|I|^{k}}$ space iff $x \in C'$

\subsection*{b}
The problem with the previous proof was that the space requirements for an arbitrary $<M>$ could grow faster than $2^n$. Consider a TM $T$ such that $L(T) = C$. Since $C$ passes in an arbitrary base $c$, $T$ needs to account for that difference in growth rate. But this $c$ is negligible, because $c^{n^k}$ can be expressed as $2^{n^{k + \epsilon}}$ for some $\epsilon$. Since the number of steps can be written as $2^{n^{x + \epsilon}}$, and since $T$ can handle any $2^{n^k}$, the base does not matter.
